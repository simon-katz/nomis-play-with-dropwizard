- Dropwizard "wiring":

  - How does it find the yml file?
    The file name is a parameter that's passed in.

  - How does it know your service class?
    That's where your `main` method is.

  - How does it know the configuration class?
    (It creates an instance of this and passes it to your `run` method.)
    I guess it knows this because the service class is parameterised with the
    configuration class.

  - Duplication of info across yml file and config files. (Names.)

- Compare `Saying` to what you would have in Clojure, and cry.

- Compare resources and adding resources to the environment with the equivalent
  Clojure, and cry.
